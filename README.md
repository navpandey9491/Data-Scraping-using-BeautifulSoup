# Data-Scraping-using-BeautifulSoup

# Goal
Working on this project gave me an idea about how data can be scrapped from websites and parsed to get clean data using BeautifulSoup library. Here we will scrap android version history data from wikipedia and work on it.

Task: 
1. To reach the web url, we have used urlopen from urllib.request
2. Reading the html data and printing it to see it.
3. Extracting the table from the html data and printing its length
4. Extracting useful information from HTML table such as Removing undesired tags
5. Now extracting all the data in the rows of the table we have extracted from HTML
6. The next step is to remove the header which is extracted along with all the rows
7. Getting the table data present in all the rows of the table
8. Now in this step we will write and read the data in comma seperated value (csv) file
9. Importing the csv file created using pandas and printing it.

After pre-processing and data cleaning we have got very nice dataset in csv format which is clean.
